# Multi-process Resource Allocation Simulation
This is a multi-process resource allocation simulation of low level operating system using FIFO and Banker's Algorithm


To run, download files 
put input into the input file (already in, for more input refer to moreInput.txt)
compile by javac main.java
run by java main

the output format will be :
1. FIFO run details
2. FIFO simple output (finish time, waiting time, percentage of time spent waiting)
3. BANKER’S run details
4. BANKER’S simple output(finish time, waiting time, percentage of time spent waiting)
